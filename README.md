## How to setup this project.

To setup this project steps are as follows: 

* At first clone the project your machine.

#### Database part

* Download PostgreSQL and install it on your machine.
* Start PostgreSQL server on your machine and create a database by name `testdb`. You can create database in other name then you have to declare that on backend module SpringBoot properties file
  * Execute the SQL scripts following:
      ` CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.roles ( id integer NOT NULL GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY ( INCREMENT 1 START 1 MINVALUE 1 MAXVALUE 2147483647 CACHE 1 ),  name character varying(20) COLLATE pg_catalog."default",  CONSTRAINT roles_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
    );
    INSERT INTO public.roles(	id, name)	VALUES (1, 'ROLE_ADMIN');
    INSERT INTO public.roles(	id, name)	VALUES (2, 'ROLE_USER');
    INSERT INTO public.roles(	id, name)	VALUES (3, 'ROLE_MODERATOR');
    INSERT INTO public.roles(	id, name)	VALUES (4, 'ROLE_READ');
    INSERT INTO public.roles(	id, name)	VALUES (5, 'ROLE_WRITE');
    INSERT INTO public.roles(	id, name)	VALUES (6, 'ROLE_UPDATE');
    INSERT INTO public.roles(	id, name)	VALUES (7, 'ROLE_DELETE');
    INSERT INTO public.roles(	id, name)	VALUES (8, 'ROLE_REPORT'); `

#### Backend part

* Download required Java_JDK on your machine which version mentioned above. And install the Java_JDK on your machine according to your Machine Operating System.
* Then download Maven mentioned above and install it on your machine.
* Go to this backend directory `/weather-forecast-application/WeatherApplication-backend`
* Open a CMD terminal and run this command `mvn clean ` and wait some moments until your terminal shows this message `BUILD SUCCESS`
* Next run this command `mvn spring-boot:run`
* Check if this message appears in your terminal `Tomcat started on port 1700 (http) with context path '/weather'` 
* Or, you can define your own port number. For that you must be declared of your port in this file `/weather-forecast-application/WeatherApplication-backend/src/main/resources/application.properties` in `server.port=` area
* Now your backend Weather forecasting application is running successfully.

### Frontend part

* Download NodeJS on your machine and install it.
* Open a CMD terminal and run this command `npm install -g npm@10.2.3`
* Next open a CMD terminal and install AngularCli@15.2.7 by running this command `npm install -g @angular/cli@15.2.7` 
* Go to this frontend directory `/weather-forecast-application/weather-app-frontend/` and open a terminal and run this command `npm install --force`
* Now go to this file `/weather-forecast-application/weather-app-frontend/src/app/constant.ts`. Check `baseURL` value match with your backend module port and context path.
* Then run this command `ng serve` . Now you can see that your frontend module running on http://localhost:4200/
